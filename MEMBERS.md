Hi! I'm a data scientist and one of the Sydney Data for Democracy community leaders. I love to help people use data to drive their goals, whether it's a corporation, for a cause or community. You can ask me anything about D4D Sydney, how we work, how to get involved, how to start something new or share some feedback - we're always tweaking our meetup format to make it the best it can be! 

### Gopi / Slack: [@gopiraga007](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@U9EJ8CY2V)

Hi! I'm a data scientist and am proud to join as a member of this Sydney Data for Democracy (D4D) community and the broader global D4D community. I like to work on social projects and am excited about using the power of AI and data to create positive social change! I have a deep interest in natural language processing and machine learning applications within retail and banking. Prior to shifting careers as a data scientist, I worked in various finance and systems-oriented roles with 5+ yearsâ€™ experience mainly in financial services and professional services.
